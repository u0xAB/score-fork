One of the most important additions to the forked Score Date is game scripting. 
Normally  in the games like “Note Reading” Score Date generates notes at random. 
You can change this by loading a script (exercise) which consists of the note sequence. 
After this the program will play notes from the sequence rather than randomly. 
When the sequence comes to an end it starts from the beginning.
The script is a simple text file, which you load with File menu, with tokens indicating notes to be played, separated by space characters. 
Each note token consists of the capital Latin letter indicating the note (C,D,E,F,G,A,B), the alteration sign (# or b) if needed and an octave number. 
So middle C is written as C4.
Each alteration sign refers only to the note it appears with.
C-major scale is written like this:
C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 B4
And D-major gamma like this:
D4 E4 F#4 G4 A4 B4 C#5
